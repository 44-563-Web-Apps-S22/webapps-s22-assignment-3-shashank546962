            <h2>Algebra - Modular Multiplicative Inverse </h2>
            <blockquote cite="https://cp-algorithms.com/index.html">Modular Multiplicative Inverse is a Algebra, that allows answering range queries. It can answer most range queries in , but its true power is answering range minimum queries (or equivalent range maximum queries). For those queries it can compute the answer in  time.

                The only drawback of this Algebra is, that it can only be used on immutable arrays. </blockquote>
