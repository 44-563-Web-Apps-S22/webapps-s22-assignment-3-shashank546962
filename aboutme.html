        <p>The Man of Masses Nandamuri Balayya is a legendary actor and an honest human being.I am his fan and love watching his movies.Now coming to the movie, Jeetendra (Jagapati Babu) is insulted in a village. So, he develops hatred on the village and the village people and its head played by Ram. Ram’s son Ravi (Balakrishna) is sent off to study by his grandmother to stop him from taking revenge. Years later, Krishna returns with the girl he loves (Sonal). After his return, he ends up having a fight with Jeetendra’s son. From then on, a tug-of-war begins between Jeetendra and Krishna. Meanwhile, there is a surprise twist in the tale.</p>
